# Plan for blog

### What is my site's primary purpose
My sites primary purpose will be to document plants that I have

### Who is my audience (is it kids, adults, academics)
Millenials that live in apartments. They are not able to have gardens so they have houseplants instead.

### How will I build my site to support their user experience
Millenials use phones as one of their primary devices outside of work, so my website will be built for mobile first.

### Wireframe - can I draw my site layout on paper? Draw it!


### What other directories do I need (e.g images). Where do I put that directory?
Images
Posts

### Do I want the style to be applied to your blog entries also?
