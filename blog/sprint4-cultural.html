							<h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
							<p>
								The medical definition of neuroplasticity predominantly deals with the brain's ability to repair itself in the case of an accident. If you were to suffer a head injury, the brain will reorganise neural pathways to preserve or relearn some of what was stored in the damaged neurons.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Understanding neuroplasticity</h3>
							<p>
								A broader description of Neuroplasticity is the brain's capacity to continually change over the course of your life. In the past it had been thought that there were some things that once learned could not be altered. We have all heard the saying “you can’t teach an old dog a new trick”, well it turns out to be incorrect. In fact you can teach a dog new tricks, also your co-workers:

							<p>
								The brain has the ability to learn new things and change perspectives on fixed opinions by conditioning through training or new experience.
							</p>

							<h3>Increasing neuroplasticity</h3>
							<p>
								There have been a number of studies that have linked meditation (a common ‘mindfulness’ technique) to a change in brain activity and structure in regions related to attention, anxiety, depression, fear, anger, and the ability of the body to heal itself. Taking time on a regular basis to condition your brain using mindfulness techniques seems like a good idea.

							<h2>Growth mindset</h2>
							<h3>What is it?</h3>
							<p>
								Mindset is a term that was coined by Dr Carol Dweck; she used it to discuss the way people view ability or talent. She suggests that ability exists on a continuum; on one side you have a fixed mindset which indicates that your abilities are unchangeable, on the other side is a growth mindset which expects that your abilities can be changed through experience and repetition.

								One of the really interesting factors is that studies have indicated people who hold the belief that their mind can grow and change will behave differently to someone who holds the belief that there mind is fixed.
							</p>

							<h3>My experience with mindset change</h3>
							<p>
								When I think about my experience with mindset over my life thus far, I think that I had a particularly fixed mindset in my teenage years and into my early twenties. I believe that my mindset began to shift over the course of my relationship with Caryn. I think that getting married thrust me into a new situation where I was confronted with another person's experience of the world. 
							</p>
							<p>
								At first I really struggled with this, I found myself working really hard to justify my position on things which were strongly held beliefs. It became clearer to me when I recognised that we had very different experiences of the world and, instead of establishing my own experience, I sort to ask questions about and understand Caryn’s experience. This is when my mind started to shift from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. This change also happened to coincide with a change in some of my core beliefs and is when I became much more sympathetic to the movements focused on diversity like feminism.
							</p>

							<h3>How I will apply it</h3>
							<p>
								Clearly having a growth mindset is going to have a positive experience on learning, because learning requires you to be able to admit when you don’t know something and seek to further understand a subject. There are still times where my natural inclination to holding a fixed mindset comes out, these are the times that I find myself so frustrated. When this happens I find it helpful to talk to someone else and find out what their experience is, this helps in two ways. First I get a chance to learn from someone else's experience, whether it be a success or a failure. Secondly I get an opportunity to see that there is more than way to approach a problem, this gives me confidence to break out of my fixed mindset and try something new.
