				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>I grew up in Upper Hutt, with my parents and 3 siblings. I am a middle child. We spent most of our holidays at Castle Point, cruising around the beach and getting up to mischief.</p>

				<p>I spend most of my time with Caryn, we have been married since 2012. We met whilst we lived in Wellington and moved to Auckland in 2014 to be closer to Need A Parts supply chain. Caryn is an impressive person, when we moved to Auckland she was employed as a nurse and she began retraining to work in public health. 5 Years on and she is now a project manager working across Surgical and Mental Health services in a non-clinical role. Caryn has given me the confidence to step out and try to shift my career.</p>

				<p>I have started two businesses. A photography business when I was 19, then I started Need A Part in my early 20’s. This year will mark 10 years since we registered the company and 11 years since I began working on it.</p>

				<h2>Interests</h2>
				<p>I really like to make things, however in saying that I am not particularly good at getting projects completed very quickly. For example, 3 - 4 years ago (I would say 3 but Caryn would say 4 - 5) I purchased a chair that I wanted to recover, I finally finished it yesterday. I am learning to sew, and upholster furniture. I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy. I regularly go rock climbing at a climbing gym and try to climb outdoors 2 - 3 times a year.</p>
