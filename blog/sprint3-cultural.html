				<h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

				<h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

				<p>Emotional intelligence is a measure of how a person responds to changes in their relationship with the environment they find themselves or perceive themselves to be in. A person's capacity to adapt and reflect on these changes with calm is highly valued.</p>

				<p>The term emotional intelligence first appeared in scientific journals in 1990 (Mayer, Salovey, & DiPaolo, 1990; Salovey & Mayer, 1990). In 2000 Mayer and Salovey defined emotional intelligence as:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>“the ability to perceive and express emotion, assimilate emotion in thought, understand and reason with emotion, and regulate emotion in the self and others.”</p>
				</blockquote>

				<h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>

				<p>Emotional intelligence emerged into the vacuum created by the focus on measuring cognitive abilities. Cognitive abilities include learning, memory and problem solving, they are often measured by IQ which has long been considered an effective measure of academic success. However it is not without its failings as David Wechsler (1940) put it, “individuals with identical IQs may differ very markedly in regard to their effective ability to cope with the environment.”</p>

				<h2>Why is it important?</h2>

				<p>In past times emotions and cognitive reasoning have often been viewed in opposition to one another. This is where measuring emotional intelligence comes into the play to provide a full picture about a person's ability to be successful in a venture, taking into account both their cognitive intellect and their ability to work with emotions.</p>
