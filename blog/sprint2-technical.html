						<h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
						<p>
							Positioning elements on a webpage can be a really challenging  concept to grasp, but it is super important if you want to be able to have elements that appear outside of the normal flow that is dictated by HTML.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div id="static-section" class="full-container">
					<div class="container blog-section">
						<h2>{ position: static }</h2>
						<p>
							When you create a website you will likely have an HTML file, with all of the content for your page, that links to a CSS file which provides the style. HTML has baked in styling to all elements including the default position property. As you have likely guessed the default in HTML is [position: static].

							<h2>Inline vs Block</h2>
							<p>
								It is worth noting that there are two different default displays, that will impact where an item will appear on the page. By default elements will either have the property [display: inline] or [display: block]. The two most common elements that you will use that illustrate this are &lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt;.
							</p>
							<div class="span6">
								<h3>{ display: inline }</h3>
								<p>
									&lt;span&gt; is an inline element. 
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										“Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content” - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements]
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									That means if you have a sentence like the one below, to make the words “brown fox” coloured brown you can place them in between &lt;span&gt; tags and apply a style to that &lt;span&gt; without removing breaking the flow of the sentence.
								</p>
								<p>
									The quick <span id="brown-fox">brown fox</span> jumps over the lazy dog
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="span6">
								<h3>{ display: block }</h3>
								<p>
									&lt;div&gt; is a block element. 
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>
										By default, a block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block." - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements]
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									That means that if we use the same example from above, but wrap the words “brown fox” in &lt;div&gt; tags instead to colour them brown, we expect that they will break the flow of the sentence. 
								</p>
								<p>The quick <div id="brown-fox">brown fox</div> jumps over the lazy dog</p>
								<p>
									<em>A &lt;span&gt; tag is much more suitable in this situation, but you could change use css div { display: inline; } and find that it will no longer break the flow of the sentence even though you are still using a &lt;div&gt;.</em>

						<h2>{ position: relative }</h2>
						<p>
							The first type of positioning we will look at is relative positioning. Relative positioning allows you to position an element on the page, moving it relative to its original static position in the normal flow.
						</p>
						<p>
							To do this you need to first change you position to relative:<br>
							{ position: relative; }
						</p>
						<p>
							Then you can use the top, right, bottom and left properties to move the element relative to its original position in the normal flow of the HTML file.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the example below if have created a class called relative, that moves the element 300px from the left of the static position, then applied it to one of the inline elements and one of the block elements.
						</p>
						
						<!-- Codepen start -->
						<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="logansruin" data-slug-hash="mgzwyZ" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Relative Positioning">
						<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/logansruin/pen/mgzwyZ/">
						Relative Positioning</a> by Jared (<a href="https://codepen.io/logansruin">@logansruin</a>)
						on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
						</p>
						<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
						<!-- Codepen end -->

						<p>
							Notice that the elements without class=”relative” applied are still in the same static position unaffected by the change to the elements with relative positioning, even though one of the inline elements now overlaps the other.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="absolute-section"class="full-container">
					<div class="container blog-section">
						<h2>{ position: absolute }</h2>
						<p>
							The second type of positioning is relative positioning. Absolute is similar to relative positioning as you are still moving an element relative to its original static position in the normal flow. How it differs is that when absolute takes the element out of the normal flow of the HTML which impacts the natural position of elements in the document flow.
						</p>
						<p>
							To do this you need to first change you position to absolute:<br>
							{ position: absolute; }
						</p>
						<p>
							Just like with relative positioning you use the top, right, bottom and left properties to move the element to a new position.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the example below if have created a class called absolute, that moves the element 300px from the left of the static position, then applied it to one of the inline elements and one of the block elements.
						</p>

						<!-- Codepen start -->
						<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="logansruin" data-slug-hash="bJmRrB" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Absolute Positioning">
						<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/logansruin/pen/bJmRrB/">
						Absolute Positioning</a> by Jared (<a href="https://codepen.io/logansruin">@logansruin</a>)
						on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
						</p>
						<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
						<!-- Codepen end -->

						<p>
							As you can see the elements without class=”absolute” applied are no longer in the original static position. The inline element has slipped left into void made by the repositioned inline element. Less noticeably the block element with the class applied has shifted down another 10px which I assume has something to do with how vertical margins are applied differently when taken out of the normal flow.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div id="fixed-section"class="full-container">
					<div class="container blog-section">
						<h2>{ position: fixed }</h2>
						<p>
							The third and final type of positioning that I will review is fixed positioning. Fixed positioning is similar to absolute and relative positioning because you can give directions to move the element relative to its original static position in the normal flow. Also like absolute positioning, but different to relative, it takes the element out of the normal flow of the HTML which impacts the natural position of elements in the document flow.
						</p>
						<p>
							It differs from both relative and absolute by fixing them into the allocated position on the screen.
						</p>
						<p>
							To do this you need to first change you position to fixed:<br>
							{ position: fixed; }
						</p>
						<p>
							Just like with relative and absolute positioning you use the top, right, bottom and left properties to move the element to a new position.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the example below if have created a class called fixed, that moves the element 300px from the left of the static position, then applied it to one of the inline elements and one of the block elements.
						</p>

						<!-- Codepen start -->
						<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="logansruin" data-slug-hash="zXmzRJ" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Fixed Positioning">
						<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/logansruin/pen/zXmzRJ/">
						Fixed Positioning</a> by Jared (<a href="https://codepen.io/logansruin">@logansruin</a>)
						on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
						</p>
						<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
						<!-- Codepen end -->

						<p>
							Take note that when you scroll this example the elements with fixed positioning do not move, it is almost as if they are stuck to your screen, the other elements move freely as you would expect to happen in a normal document flow.
