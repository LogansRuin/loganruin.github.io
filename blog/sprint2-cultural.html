				<h1>Learning plan</h1>
				<h2>Long term goal</h2>
				<p>
					My long term goal is to work in a software company as an Agile accredited product owner or equivalent position. I expect that I may take a juniorish position when I leave Dev Academy, but I will be looking for opportunities that will leverage my experience as a business owner, employer and founder of a successful ecommerce business.
				</p>
				<h2>Non-technical - human skills</h2>
				<p>
					Having worked for myself, and being in a management position for the last few years, I am looking forward to spending time working as part of a team where each of us will bring our own strengths. I am looking forward to taking leadership roles where needed and building up & supporting others to take leadership on projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					In particular I am looking forward to improving my listening skills. I often find myself taking part in discussions by contributing my thoughts and opinions, even in cases where I may not be very knowledgeable. This will be a good opportunity for me to practise reflective listening and seek to learn from other’s experiences.
				</p>

				<h2>Stregnths and limitations</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Experience</strong> - I bring with me experience working with software that has developed over the last 10 years. This has given me an insight into the design and processes that enrich user experience and how that is balanced against technical limitations of given platforms or dev decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Creativity</strong> - I am a creative problem solver. I enjoy looking at a problem or opportunity and working to come up with a creative approach.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Teamwork</strong> - I am a relational person. I look forward to working as a part of a team; learning from others and building people up so that we can achieve great success.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Perfectionism</strong> - I have only recently learnt this about myself. This can really hold me back from releasing a product at MVP stage and sometimes I can get caught up in the big picture trying to plan the perfect idea.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Business</strong> - I own and operate a business. That can mean that sometimes my business can take my attention that is needed elsewhere.
				</p>

				<h2>Commitments</h2>
				<p>
					I am committed to making this completing this program and looking for opportunities to learn from others around me. I am excited to be taking time away from being self employed and working to learn new skills with other people who are similarly motivated.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have made changes to my working life to clearway for this time of study, I have employed an office manager who will run the day to day operations and intend to rely more heavily on my business partner to cover issues that I otherwise would handle directly. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I intend to review a task, spend time scoping the project and planning a minimum product before I get started. This should protect me from getting carried away trying to build the perfect product getting in the way of my learning outcomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I find myself at a roadblock, having tried to solve an issue myself, I will reach out to my cohort and extended community for help and advice before reaching out to the EDA staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					I expect that the EDA team will shape an environment which maximises learning opportunities and offer guidance around balancing life whilst in the bootcamp.
