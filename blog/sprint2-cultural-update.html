				<h1>Updated Learning plan</h1>
				<h2>Long term goal</h2>
				<p>
					While my long term goal is still to work in a software company as an Agile accredited product owner or equivalent position. Foundations has made me think a little broader.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to work with people that approach problems seeking an understanding then coming together to build beautiful solutions. My last 11 years has been spent trying to solve what seemed like a small problem on the surface; as we peeled back the layers we found a problem with systemic roots. Our team was to small to solve this problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am not sure where I plan to end up, I do know that it is important to work in a team that values creativity and is resourced to apply novel as well as practical solutions
				</p>
				<h2>Non-technical - human skills</h2>
				<p>
					I think that my biggest struggle has always been putting in the hard yards with research for a project, or making a plan before getting started. I just want to get started with solving the problem or answering the question. Part of this is that I am perhaps over confident in my abilities and the other part of it is that I hate planning. Like, it makes me cringe when Caryn says we need to plan our weekend out or some other trivial event.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having worked for myself, and being in a management position for the last few years, I am looking forward to spending time working as part of a team where each of us will bring our own strengths. I am looking forward to taking leadership roles where needed and building up & supporting others to take leadership on projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					In particular I am looking forward to improving my listening skills. I often find myself taking part in discussions by contributing my thoughts and opinions, even in cases where I may not be very knowledgeable. This will be a good opportunity for me to practise reflective listening and seek to learn from other’s experiences.
				</p>

				<h2>Stregnths and limitations</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Experience</strong> - I bring with me experience working with software that has developed over the last 10 years. This has given me an insight into the design and processes that enrich user experience and how that is balanced against technical limitations of given platforms or dev decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Creativity</strong> - I am a creative problem solver. I enjoy looking at a problem or opportunity and working to come up with a creative approach.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Teamwork</strong> - I am a relational person. I look forward to working as a part of a team; learning from others and building people up so that we can achieve great success.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Perfectionism</strong> - I have only recently learnt this about myself. This can really hold me back from releasing a product at MVP stage and sometimes I can get caught up in the big picture trying to plan the perfect idea.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Procrastination</strong> - This goes hand in hand with my perfectionism. Sometimes when I am unable to meet my high expectations I can find myself doing literally anything else.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Business</strong> - I own and operate a business. That can mean that sometimes my business can take my attention that is needed elsewhere.
				</p>

				<h2>Commitments</h2>
				<p>
					I know that there is a lot of content to absorb, and a small time in which to take it in. I am looking forward to some long days, and expect to be both a support to and supported by the other members of the cohort. If foundations has taught me one thing, people grow better together.
				</p>
				<p>
					I plan to make time for mindfulness and physical exercise, giving me a place to keep my mind clear. I am expecting some long days, particularly towards the end, so each week I will reflect on my learnings so that I can be confident that I am on the right path and that I have not missed out any content.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am committed to making this completing this program and looking for opportunities to learn from others around me. I am excited to be taking time away from being self employed and working to learn new skills with other people who are similarly motivated.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have made changes to my working life to clearway for this time of study, I have employed an office manager who will run the day to day operations and intend to rely more heavily on my business partner to cover issues that I otherwise would handle directly. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I intend to review a task, spend time scoping the project and planning a minimum product before I get started. This should protect me from getting carried away trying to build the perfect product getting in the way of my learning outcomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I find myself at a roadblock, having tried to solve an issue myself, I will reach out to my cohort and extended community for help and advice before reaching out to the EDA staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					I expect that the EDA team will shape an environment which maximises learning opportunities and offer guidance around balancing life whilst in the bootcamp.
