						<h2>Core learnings</h2>
						<p>These are the three top things that I have learnt about myself as a result of the core part of the programme</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="span4">
							<h3>Coaching</h3>
							<p>
								I love working along side of other people, I particularly like it when I get the opportunity to coach another person and help them improve. That gives me a real buzz, I feel their success as if it were my own.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="span4">
							<h3>Ambition</h3>
							<p>
								Sometimes I can have particularly ambitious ideas about what I want my program to do. Ambition is fine, it is the down feelings if I do not meet my lofty goals. I will need to be aware of this, constant evaluation and adjustment of my expectations will be required.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="span4">
							<h3>Perfection</h3>
							<p>
								In the same vein as the last one, I am a bit of a perfectionist. This combined with ambition can be a really dangerous combination, especially when I am learning new content. It is OK to expect a high quality when you have a lot of experience but while I am learning I will need to make sure that I don’t get hung up on the finer details and let that get in the way of achieving the requirements of the programme.

						<h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
						<p>
							I was most surprised by the amount of time I put in to some of the core learning exercises and blogs. Often I would find myself spending two or three times more than what was suggested in the timebox. This is not because I found it tricky or difficult to understand, but I feel like I got a lot out of the process.
						</p>
						<h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
						<p>
							It has been challenging for me to prioritise core learning practices. Often, as the case today, I have left the core section to the weekend and found myself compiling my blog or reflections on Sunday night. I really need to spend a bit more time learning to spend more time on core learning each day.
						</p>
						<h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
						<p>
							I think that people always benefit from having a better understanding of themselves. It makes it easier for them to work as part of a team. It is really hard to be successful in a team environment if you have not thought about what your personality needs to be successful, it is even harder if you are not able to see what other people need to be successful. I personally have found it really fulfilling coming into the campus on a regular basis because I lean toward extraversion, however more introverted personalities are going to need to be aware of the burden that spending some much time in others company will make.
						</p>
						<p>
							I also think that there are times when you have been working for hours on a piece of code that just doesn’t work. Using reflection tools and mindfulness practices can really help you to see the valuable lessons that you have learned. 
						</p>
						<h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</h2>
						<p>
							I loved it. I feel like it has helped me grow,given me the space to process my emotions and order my thoughts. If I had spent more time programming, I don’t think that it would have resulted in anything as valuable.
