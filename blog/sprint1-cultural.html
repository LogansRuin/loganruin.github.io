				<h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>

				<h2>Ethical decision</h2>
				<p>
					When I was in my mid twenties, not long after Caryn and I married, we decided together that we no longer carried the same beliefs that we had grown up with. This was particularly difficult because almost all of our extended community, family and friends, held these same beliefs. For the two of us it would have been easy to continue with the status quo and not rock the boat by telling people that we had different ideas. I knew that some people would be hurt and find it difficult to understand our change of perspective.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ethical decision I was faced with was whether to tell people or not. Most people would not find out, as we were soon moving away and it would not really have a significant bearing on their day to day lives or how we interacted with each other. On the other hand it is important to me that I don’t mislead people, and I felt that If I did not tell them that I would have to avoid certain topics and uphold a series of small lies.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the end I opted to tell people in when I had the chance. Some people took it hard and required months even years of conversations to understand how we could change our minds. Others were hurt but moved to build a new picture and foundation for our relationships. In a few cases the friendships came to a close.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I reflect on this I realise how important authenticity is to me. I would have found it difficult to mislead these people, or perhaps not correct them when they made an assumption about my beliefs. I have found that by being authentic with people about my ideas, without trying to convince them that they are wrong has lead to stronger relationships regardless of their beliefs.
				</p>

				<h2>Culture</h2>
				<p>
					My Parents created a loving household, where hard work was highly valued and weekends were spent trimming hedges and doing jobs around the house. I grew up in a pakeha family, I am one of 4 children. In my house there were always renovations happening. Caryn and I were talking about how many renovations my parents have completed; I can tell you that it is more than I can count on all of my digits. My parents are still together and are sometimes gross about their affection for one another and other times bickering about the best position for a new lightswitch location.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having grown up with this experience I see the value in working hard for your dream. My parents had a dream of a beautiful home and life for their family. They have shown me to work hard for your dreams and above all value the relationships with the family you have around you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Growing up as a Pakeha in New Zealand, I had a privileged upbringing and still benefit from the bias set up in our Colonial and Patriarchal society. I have been privileged to live with a strongly identifying feminist, which has given me a different lens through which to view the world. I now view the world in a much less binary manner and understand that it is my responsibility to use my privilege to bolster those with a less powerful voice.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
				<p>
					I completed the questionnaire on www.16personalities.com and was assigned the personality type of the Campaigner (ENFP-T), it lists my Strengths and weaknesses as:
				</p>
				<h3>Strengths</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Curious</li>
					<li>Observant</li>
					<li>Energetic and enthusiastic</li>
					<li>Excellent communicator</li>
					<li>Know how to relax</li>
					<li>Very popular and friendly</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Poor practical skills</li>
					<li>Find it difficult to focus</li>
					<li>Overthink things</li>
					<li>Get stressed easily</li>
					<li>Highly emotional</li>
					<li>Independent to a fault</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					You can see a full breakdown of the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-strengths-and-weaknesses">strengths and weaknesses of the campaigner here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I Identify well with most of the strengths listed for this personality type, when I am working to my strengths I am working as part of a team.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst I do recognise the listed weaknesses as character flaws that I share, I believe that I have already built up strategies and tools to support me when I am working outside of my comfort zone. For instance poor practical skills suggests that I will be unable to conduct administrative tasks, I find that I try to mix administrative tasks with other tasks so that they do not become mundane. Fortunately I like to complete what I start and sometimes administration is just part of the project. However you won’t find me applying for any purely administrative roles, that will drive me up the wall.
				</p>
				<p>
					I do have a habit of catastrophizing. This can be really debilitating, and create an obstacle to completing a project or maintain focus on a task. I will be practicing more and more mindfulness to counter this, and making sure that I take breaks when I feel myself begin to spiral.
				</p> 
				<p>
					There are not many experiences where I have had significant obstacles when trying to work with others. However, working at Need A Part I have come across some occasions where there has been a personality clash with key people on a project. My strategy has been to take a step back and try to understand what both of us are trying to get, then to change my approach so that we can work more productively together. I found that it is best to try to be flexible when working with others.
